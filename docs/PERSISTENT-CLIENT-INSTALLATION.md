## 🔧 **How Technicians Install Persistent Access**

### **Step 1: Generate Custom Client Package**
```bash
cd builder
python create-persistent-client.py --support-code "123456" --customer-info "John Smith - Home Computer"
```

This creates a **customized installation package** specifically for that customer.

### **Step 2: Send Package to Customer**
- Package is created as: `output/ConnectAssist-Persistent-Client-123456.zip`
- Send this ZIP file to the customer via email or download link
- Package contains everything needed for persistent installation

### **Step 3: Guide Customer Through ONE-TIME Installation**

**Customer Instructions (Technician guides via phone/chat):**

1. **Extract the ZIP file** to Desktop or Downloads folder
2. **Right-click** on `setup-connectassist.bat`
3. **Select** "Run as administrator"
4. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
5. **Follow** the installation prompts
6. **Wait** for "Installation completed successfully!" message

**That's it!** After this ONE-TIME setup, the customer never needs to do anything again.
