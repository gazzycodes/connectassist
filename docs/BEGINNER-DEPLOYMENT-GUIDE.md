- SSH access to your VPS (already verified above)

### Step-by-Step SCP Deployment

#### 1. Prepare Files Locally
```bash
# On your local machine, navigate to your ConnectAssist folder
cd /path/to/your/connectassist/folder

# Create a compressed archive
tar -czf connectassist.tar.gz *
```

#### 2. Transfer Files to VPS
```bash
# Transfer the archive to your VPS
scp connectassist.tar.gz root@103.195.103.198:/opt/

# Connect to VPS
ssh root@103.195.103.198
```

#### 3. Extract and Set Up on VPS
```bash
# On the VPS
cd /opt
tar -xzf connectassist.tar.gz
mkdir -p connectassist
mv * connectassist/ 2>/dev/null || true
cd connectassist

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x *.sh

# Continue with Step 4 from the main guide above
```

### Updating Files with SCP
When you make changes locally:
```bash
# Create new archive
tar -czf connectassist-update.tar.gz *

# Transfer to VPS
scp connectassist-update.tar.gz root@103.195.103.198:/opt/

# On VPS: backup current version and update
ssh root@103.195.103.198
cd /opt
cp -r connectassist connectassist-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
cd connectassist
tar -xzf ../connectassist-update.tar.gz
```
