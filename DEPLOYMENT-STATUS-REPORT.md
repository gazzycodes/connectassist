## ‚ùå CURRENT BLOCKER: SSH ACCESS FAILURE

### Problem Description
SSH password authentication is consistently failing for all attempted credentials and users:

**Attempted Credentials:**
- `root@103.195.103.198` with password `ConnectAssist2024!` - ‚ùå Permission denied
- `root@103.195.103.198` with password `Kx9#mP2$vL8@nQ5!` - ‚ùå Permission denied  
- `ubuntu@103.195.103.198` with password `ConnectAssist2024!` - ‚ùå Permission denied
- `root@connectassist.live` with both passwords - ‚ùå Permission denied

**SSH Connection Details:**
- SSH connection establishes successfully (TCP connection works)
- Server responds: "Authentications that can continue: publickey,password"
- Password authentication is enabled on server
- All password attempts result in "Permission denied"

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Password Changed**: VPS provider may have changed root password
2. **Account Locked**: Multiple failed attempts may have locked the account
3. **SSH Configuration**: Password authentication may be restricted
4. **User Account**: Root user may be disabled, different user required
5. **VPS Provider Security**: Provider may have implemented additional security measures

## üöÄ ALTERNATIVE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: VPS Provider Control Panel
**Action Required**: Access VPS through provider's web-based control panel
- Log into Evolution Host control panel
- Use web-based terminal or file manager
- Upload and execute deployment scripts manually
- **Advantage**: Bypasses SSH authentication issues
- **Status**: Requires VPS provider access credentials

### Strategy 2: SSH Key Authentication
**Action Required**: Generate and configure SSH keys
- Generate SSH key pair locally
- Upload public key to VPS via provider control panel
- Use key-based authentication instead of password
- **Advantage**: More secure and reliable than password auth
- **Status**: Requires VPS provider access to configure

### Strategy 3: Alternative User Account
**Action Required**: Identify correct user account and credentials
- Contact VPS provider for current credentials
- Check if non-root user exists (ubuntu, admin, connectassist)
- Verify current password or request password reset
- **Advantage**: Uses existing SSH infrastructure
- **Status**: Requires communication with VPS provider

### Strategy 4: Web-Based Deployment (Recommended)
**Action Required**: Deploy via web interface once SSH access is restored
- Use created PHP deployment script (`www/deploy.php`)
- Access via: `https://connectassist.live/deploy.php?action=deploy&key=ConnectAssist2024Deploy`
- **Advantage**: No SSH required after initial setup
- **Status**: Requires one-time SSH access to deploy the PHP script

### Strategy 5: GitHub Webhook Integration
**Action Required**: Set up automated deployment
- Configure GitHub webhook to trigger on push
- Set up deployment script to run automatically
- **Advantage**: Fully automated future deployments
- **Status**: Requires initial SSH access for setup

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Restore VPS Access
1. **Contact VPS Provider (Evolution Host)**
   - Request current root password or password reset
   - Verify SSH access configuration
   - Check for any account restrictions or security measures

2. **Alternative Access Methods**
   - Request web-based terminal access
   - Ask for SSH key configuration assistance
   - Verify if non-root user accounts exist

### Priority 2: Deploy Customer Portal Integration
Once VPS access is restored:

1. **Pull Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/connectassist
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Run Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x manual-deploy.sh
   ./manual-deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Test admin dashboard: https://connectassist.live/admin/
   - Test API status: https://connectassist.live/api/status
   - Test customer portal workflow

### Priority 3: End-to-End Testing
1. **Admin Dashboard Testing**
   - Generate support codes
   - Manage devices and connections
   - Verify all dashboard functionality

2. **Customer Portal Testing**
   - Enter support codes
   - Download custom installers
   - Verify complete workflow

3. **API Integration Testing**
   - Test all customer endpoints
