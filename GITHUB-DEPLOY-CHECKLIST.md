## ðŸ”§ Quick Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Quick Fixes

#### Repository Issues
**Problem**: "Repository not found" during git clone
```bash
# Fix: Check repository URL and make sure it's public
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/connectassist.git
```

**Problem**: "Permission denied" during git operations
```bash
# Fix: Ensure you're using the correct repository URL
# For public repos, HTTPS should work without authentication
```

#### File Permission Issues
**Problem**: "Permission denied" when running scripts
```bash
# Fix: Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x *.sh
```

#### Service Startup Issues
**Problem**: Docker containers not starting
```bash
# Check Docker service
systemctl status docker
systemctl start docker

# Check container logs
cd /opt/connectassist
docker-compose logs
```

**Problem**: NGINX not starting
```bash
# Check NGINX configuration
nginx -t

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -tuln | grep :80
netstat -tuln | grep :443

# Restart NGINX
systemctl restart nginx
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues
**Problem**: SSL certificate creation fails
```bash
# Check domain DNS
nslookup connectassist.live

# Verify domain points to your VPS IP
dig connectassist.live

# Try manual certificate creation
certbot certonly --standalone -d connectassist.live --email admin@connectassist.live
```

#### Website Access Issues
**Problem**: Website shows default NGINX page
```bash
# Check site configuration
ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

**Problem**: "Connection refused" or timeout
```bash
# Check firewall
ufw status

# Reset firewall if needed
ufw --force reset
./scripts/init-server.sh  # This will reconfigure firewall
```

## ðŸ”„ Update Workflow Checklist

### When Making Changes
- [ ] Update files locally
- [ ] Test changes locally (if possible)
- [ ] Commit to GitHub: `git add . && git commit -m "Description"`
- [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

### Deploying Updates to VPS
- [ ] SSH to VPS: `ssh root@103.195.103.198`
- [ ] Navigate to project: `cd /opt/connectassist`
- [ ] Pull updates: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Restart services if needed: `docker-compose restart`
- [ ] Verify deployment: `./scripts/health-check.sh`

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Procedures

### Complete Service Restart
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down
systemctl stop nginx

# Start all services
systemctl start nginx
docker-compose up -d

# Verify everything is working
./scripts/health-check.sh --report
```

### Rollback to Previous Version
```bash
# Check commit history
git log --oneline

# Rollback to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Complete Redeployment
```bash
# Backup current installation
cp -r /opt/connectassist /opt/connectassist-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Fresh clone
rm -rf /opt/connectassist
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/connectassist.git /opt/connectassist
cd /opt/connectassist

# Reconfigure and redeploy
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
nano docker/.env  # Update settings
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/init-server.sh
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Website loads at https://connectassist.live
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid (green lock in browser)
- [ ] Download buttons are functional
- [ ] Health check reports "All health checks passed"
- [ ] Docker containers show "Up" status
- [ ] NGINX and Docker services are "active (running)"

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Build Custom Clients**
   - Configure `builder/builder-config.json`
   - Run `python3 builder/rustdesk-builder.py`

2. **Customize Branding**
   - Edit `www/index.html` and `www/assets/style.css`
   - Update company information and colors

3. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Configure email alerts in health check script
   - Set up log monitoring

4. **Plan for Scale**
   - Consider subdomain setup for multiple clients
   - Plan backup and disaster recovery procedures
